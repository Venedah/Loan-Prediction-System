## Problem Statement
Banks' primary business is lending. The main source of profit is the interest on the loan. After an extensive verification and validation process, the loan companies grant a loan. They do not, however, have assurance that the applicant will be able to repay the loan without difficulty. In the lending industry, the two most important questions are:

    1. What is the borrower's risk level?
    2. Should we lend to the borrower, given his/her risk?
